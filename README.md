## ADP
This program has been designed to provide quick and simple provisional diagnosis based on the prediction made through machine learning(ML). The program requires a list of signs and/or symptoms from the user.

## version
This is the first released version, ADP 1.0.

## Purpose
This version is for educational purposes __ONLY__. More refirements are needed for the best experience. The features currently supported are;
1. prediction of a disease from a list of signs and/symptoms.
1. Saving the results obtained in the '.docx' format for later preview.
1. Exporting the results.
1. Quick access of standard treatment guidelines for confirmation of diagnosis and treatment. The STG that comes with the program can be changed.


## Training
The models that have been used are:
* Gaussian Naive-Bayes Algorithm
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Classifier

The dataset that has been used to train the models was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning "kaggle disease prediction dataset").

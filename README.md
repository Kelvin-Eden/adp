## ADP
This program is designed to offer prompt provisional diagnoses using predictions made through machine learning(ML). The program requires the user to provide a list of signs and/or symptoms.

## version
This is the first released version, ADP 1.0. Currently, there is an installer for windows 64-bits OS. The link to download it is [windows(64-bits)](https://github.com/Kelvin-Eden/adp/releases/download/untagged-8537b8d845ddb138168f/adp_win64.exe "ADP installer")

## Purpose
This version is for educational purposes __ONLY__. More refirements are needed for the best experience. The features currently supported are;
1. Prediction of a disease from a list of signs and/or symptoms.

1. Exporting the results.
1. Quick access of standard treatment guidelines for attestation of diagnosis and treatment. The STG that comes with the program can be changed.


## Training
The models that have been used are:
* Gaussian Naive-Bayes Algorithm
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Support Vector Classifier

The dataset that has been used to train the models was downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning "kaggle disease prediction dataset").
The standard treatment guidelines file that comes with program was downloaded from [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://hssrc.tamisemi.go.tz/storage/app/uploads/public/5ab/e9b/b21/5abe9bb216267130384889.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwim7rbQt77-AhWhwQIHHRLkAoYQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2eGcZjE1xd1epWN6H6O7RY "STG").
